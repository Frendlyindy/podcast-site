# Overview

I unfortunately have been unable to run the node server. Using live server on VSCode provides the same effect for now, still working on the node part of my website. Mainly, the site is two pages that I am using to build up my skills to making my own website. I have made one page to start building my site design, and one page that handles some user input so I could teach my self that a little bit more. It takes the users name and adds a line of text welcoming the user to the site. Most of the page is created through JavaScript, aside from direct HTML in the input and submit button.

# Web Pages

The first page adds in the basic site info that will show on each apge, plus a site description. It adds our podcast logo, title adn so on. This is all done in JavaScript.
As I mentioned above, the second page takes user input and adds it to a string that is displayed on screen. THis is all done in JavaScript as well, aside from the input box, its label and the submit button.
